Project Title:
BMI Calculator: Your Path to a Healthier You.

Problem Description:
Our project aims to address the growing concern of health and wellness by providing a BMI calculator. BMI is a widely accepted indicator of one's health, and it helps individuals understand where they stand in terms of their weight and health. With the increasing prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, having an accessible BMI calculator can be a valuable tool to encourage healthier choices and lifestyle changes.
